# EntrepreneurCalculator.online

## Overview
EntrepreneurCalculator.online is an innovative tool designed to assist entrepreneurs in evaluating the 
potential success of their upcoming business ventures. By analyzing the number of past businesses and 
using data-driven insights, this calculator provides an estimated success chance for new endeavors. 
Our aim is to empower entrepreneurs with knowledge and confidence as they venture into new business 
opportunities.

## How It Works
The calculator operates on a simple yet powerful principle derived from market analysis data. 
According to research conducted by ScrapingFish.com on IndieHackers.com, only around 5% of the 
products analyzed generate a monthly revenue exceeding $8,333 (approximately $100,000/year). Based on 
this statistic, the Entrepreneur Calculator estimates the chances of success for your next business 
using the following formula:

- **Chance Of Failure** = (0.95)^(Number Of Businesses Youâ€™ve Had)
- **Chance Of Success** = 1 - Chance of Failure

Simply enter the number of past businesses you've had to calculate the success chances of your next 
venture.
